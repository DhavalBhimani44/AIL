Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning technique. It groups similar data points without labels. The algorithm finds patterns independently. K-means clustering is a popular method. It assigns points to K clusters based on distance. In 2023, clustering is used in marketing. It segments customers for targeted campaigns. In biology, it groups similar genes.

Clustering has challenges. Choosing the right number of clusters is difficult. Too few clusters oversimplify the data. Too many create noise. The shape of data matters too. K-means works best with spherical clusters. Non-spherical data may lead to poor results. Hierarchical clustering is another approach. It builds a tree of clusters. Social media analysis uses clustering. It identifies trends in user behavior. However, scalability is an issue. Large datasets slow down clustering. Researchers are developing faster algorithms.
