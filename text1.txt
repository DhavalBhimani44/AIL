Neural networks are a cornerstone of machine learning. They mimic the human brainâ€™s structure. A neural network consists of neurons organized in layers. The input layer receives data, such as images or numbers. Hidden layers process this data through weighted connections. The output layer produces results, like classifications. In 2023, neural networks are widely used. They power image recognition systems. For example, they identify faces in photos.

Training neural networks requires large datasets. A method called backpropagation adjusts weights to minimize errors. This process needs significant computing power. Deep learning is a subset of neural networks. It uses many hidden layers for complex tasks. Speech recognition benefits from deep learning. So does natural language processing. However, overfitting is a challenge. It occurs when the model learns the training data too well. Neural networks also raise ethical concerns. Privacy issues arise from data collection. Researchers are addressing these problems.
