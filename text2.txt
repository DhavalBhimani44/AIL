Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm. They split data based on features. For instance, a medical dataset might split on age or symptoms. Each split forms a branch in the tree. The leaves represent classifications or decisions. Decision trees are easy to interpret. They resemble flowcharts, making them user-friendly. In 2022, they were used in finance. They predicted loan defaults with high accuracy.

However, decision trees can overfit. Overfitting happens when the tree is too complex. It performs poorly on new data. To address this, pruning reduces unnecessary branches. Random forests improve decision trees. They combine multiple trees for better predictions. Decision trees are also used in marketing. Companies target customers based on tree outputs. The algorithm is fast and scalable. Still, it struggles with imbalanced datasets. Researchers are improving tree-based methods.
